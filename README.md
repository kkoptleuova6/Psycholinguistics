Sociolinguistic and extralinguistic aspects of the functioning of the Kazakh-Russian-English trilingualism in the oil industry of Kazakhstan
The purpose of the research: This paper describes the linguistic situation in the oil industry of Kazakhstan. The linguistic situation in the oil industry of Kazakhstan is characterized by functioning of the trilingualism with three languages being used simultaneously - Kazakh, Russian and English. 
Methods and procedure of research: A survey was conducted among industry staff for the level identification of Kazakh-Russian-English trilingualism. Based on questionnaire method, we interviewed 600 oil industry specialists comparing the level of proficiency in the second and third languages, identifying the level of activity and particular spheres of communication for L1, L2, L3 for informants with different socio-demographic characteristics as well as individual motivations when choosing, studying and using the second and third languages 
Results: Obtained records point out that the forms of interaction of the Kazakh, Russian and English languages are far from being similar. Kazakhs who do not know their native language, but only understand certain phrases make up 2.7%. Statistical data analysis revealed that 80.6% of Kazakhs are fluent in Russian, 1.4% of Kazakhs do not know Russian, 1% of Kazakhs are able to understand certain phrases. The age groups of 21-25, 26-35, and 36-45 have the highest English speakers percentage.
Conclusions: The Kazakh-Russian-English trilingualism is widespread among representatives of various social and professional groups of the oil industry, who speak their native Kazakh and Russian languages fluently, and also know how to communicate in English
